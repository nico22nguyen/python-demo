# A*
For A* Pathfinding, run A*.py. A pygame screen will pop up with a grid, and you can select a target, a start point, and set up any obstacles (in that order).
Hit start, and the A* algorithm will run slowly to give a glimpse into how it works. Press Start again to reset.

# Number Guesser
The Number guesser project was something I took on as my first dive into machine learning. I've always found it interesting so I figured I would try it out.
The number guesser is trained on both data from a large online collection and, my own supervised training test data.
There is also a commented out section of the code that allows you to continue training by providing a label along with your drawing
To use the number guesser, run interface.py

A pygame window will pop up with a drawing section, a yellow button, and a white button. 
Draw a digit in the drawing section (0-9) and the number guesser will attempt to guess what number you drew.
The white button resets your drawing and the yellow button submits it to the number guesser to make a prediction.
The prediction will appear in the terminal window.

# Note:
For both of these programs, the user interface is not what it should be as a finished application. I was mostly focused on the functionality of the code than the usability as an app since I was the only one who would be using it, so please excuse the poor UI.
